# AI-Spring2025

This repository hosts a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and related materials, likely developed for an Artificial Intelligence course or as a series of projects during the Spring 2025 semester. The notebooks explore various concepts and implementations within AI and machine learning.

## Repository Contents

This repository primarily consists of Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) demonstrating different AI techniques:

* **`DT.ipynb`**: explores Decision Trees.
* **`NN-NumPy.ipynb`**: Suggests an implementation of Neural Networks using NumPy from scratch.
* **`NN-PyTorch-CIFAR10.ipynb`**: Indicates a Neural Network project using PyTorch for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* **`NN-PyTorch-MNIST.ipynb`**: Suggests a Neural Network project using PyTorch for digit recognition on the MNIST dataset.
* **`autoencoder-NN.ipynb`**: Neural Network-based Autoencoder.
* **`autoencoder-conv.ipynb`**: Suggests a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Autoencoder.
* **`image_classifier_from_scratch.ipynb`**: Indicates an image classifier built without relying heavily on high-level libraries (from scratch).
* **`logic-circuit.ipynb`**:
* **`multilayer_perceptron.ipynb`**: Focuses on Multilayer Perceptrons (a type of feedforward neural network).
* **`sin-x.ipynb`**:
